# ThinkPad
Python version of notepad
I tried to implement the mail feature but didn't get enough time to work on it
so for mail we will take second session some other day
mail feature is basically sending the content of pad to some other guy on mail

and bro do webinar session
then they can start the audio and ask doubts
